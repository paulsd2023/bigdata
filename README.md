# bigdata
GSBA576 Project
I’ve created this github repository.
•	The only file in here so far is HealthData.csv. This is our master data file. Do not edit.
•	One of us will need to generate the 70% training data in R. We will also need to clean the file above first.
•	I propose we call the training data HealthDataTraining70.csv and the test data HealthDataTest30.csv (which later I think we’ll need to subdivide into HealthDataTest15A.csv and HealthDataTest15B.csv
