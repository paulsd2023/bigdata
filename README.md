# bigdata
GSBA576 Project
I’ve created a github repository. You should have received an invitation – let me know if not.
•	The only file in there so far is HealthData.csv. This is our master data file. Do not use yet.
•	First, one of us will need to generate the 70% training data in R. We may also need to clean the file above.
•	I propose we call the training data HealthDataTraining70.csv and the test data HealthDataTest30.csv (which later I think we’ll need to subdivide into HealthDataTest15A.csv and HealthDataTest15B.csv

Hope this makes sense – I haven’t read the instructions yet, so kick me if I’m wrong.
